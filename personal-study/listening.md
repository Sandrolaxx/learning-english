### Translate - My work

Esse é um download do BBC Learning English. Para mais, acesse nosso site. O programa de hoje é sobre inglês acadêmico. Se você vai estudar, ou se você já estuda em uma universidade que fala inglês, você pode ponderar combinar entender palestras e textos acadêmicos com escrita de um ensaio. Inglês acadêmico é muito diferente do inglês falado e escrito pelas pessoas no dia-a-dia, é mais formal e usa palavras de alto nível, então no programa de hoje vamos te dar algumas ideias para entender palavras, frases que você verá, conselhos para escrever redações e realizar apresentações.

Mas primeiro, vamos ver as três principais funções do inglês acadêmico: dificuldade do vocabulário em inglês, vocabulário específico de um assunto, linguagem para organizar uma ensaio e apresentação. Agora, quando você passar por uma palavra que você não conhece em um texto acadêmico ou palestras, você pode tentar buscar o significado entendendo o contexto ou tentando encontrar palavras parecidas na sua própria língua. Essa estratégia é particularmente útil se a sua própria língua tem muitas palavras originadas do grego ou do latim, muitas palavras no inglês acadêmico vêm dessas línguas. Por exemplo, palavras como microscópio, que significa pequeno, ou análise, quer dizer estudo, ou regeneração, que quer dizer renovar, outra estratégia é buscar como a palavra é construída. No inglês acadêmico, temos normalmente prefixos e sufixos.

Lembre-se! O prefixo em antes da parte principal da palavra e pode mudar o significado da palavra. Por exemplo, o prefixo `d` se fala `de` quer dizer remover algo ou inverter algo, então `d-population` quer dizer redução do número de pessoas em uma área, e `d-forestation` quer dizer remover as árvores de uma área.

Sufixos são adicionados ao fim das palavras, um sufixo comum em inglês é o `ze`, que se fala `asi`, exemplos de palavras com `ze` é `stabilize`, `caractarize`, e `specialize`, essas palavras se pronuncia com `AZEDI` no inglês americano, certo, é mesmo, agora outro sufixo comum é o `ted` falado `eti`, palavras com esse sufixo são `differentiated` e `duplicated`, palavras de assuntos especialistas podem ser difíceis, agora você pode se ajudar de duas maneiras, primeiro prepare você mesmo antes das palestras, encontre alguns textos sobre o assunto na internet ou jornais/revistas e estude recorrentemente as palavras especialistas nesses texto, sim, isso vai te ajudar, pegue um dicionário em inglês e um dicionário em inglês do assunto, por exemplo, medicina, direito ou letras, por segundo ouça o inglês no rádio e assista TV, lá tem muitos especialistas que podem te ajudar a melhorar tanto seu inglês geral quanto o especialista e é claro a uma série de cursos no site da BBC com seções de histórias de tecnologia, ciência, artes que também podem te ajudar.

Quando você está escrevendo um artigo acadêmico ou realizando uma apresentação, você precisa estruturar e organizar sua escrita ou apresentação utilizando.
Utilizando linguagem de sinalização, você usa sinalização para indicar partes importantes do seu ensaio, como declarar o propósito, estruturar sua visão, os principais pontos, a direção do seu argumento e a conclusão no final, também é legal, juntando palavras e frases e apresentando a conexão entre sentenças e parágrafos, sim, Neil vamos dar alguns exemplos e sinalização, primeiramente ao iniciar um texto, "o objetivo desse estudo", "esse ensaio argumenta que"
, e então como finalizar ele, "finalmente", "em conclusão", alguns exemplos de junção de palavras e frases são, "primeiramente", "segundamente", "finalmente", e para adicionar algo que você quer escrever, "em adição", "além disso/ademais", e se quiser mostrar contraste, você pode escrever, "com tudo", "no entanto", "na outra mão".

Este é um download da BBC Learning English. Para saber mais, visite nosso site. O programa de hoje é sobre inglês acadêmico. Se você vai estudar ou está estudando em uma universidade de língua inglesa, pode estar se perguntando como combinar a compreensão de palestras e textos acadêmicos com a redação de ensaios. O inglês acadêmico é diferente do inglês que os ingleses falam e escrevem todos os dias, é mais formal e usa palavras de nível superior, por isso, no programa de hoje, daremos a você ideias para entender palavras e frases que você encontra e alguns conselhos para escrever uma redação e apresentações. Também daremos dicas para estudar inglês.

Mas primeiro, vamos dar uma olhada nas três características principais do inglês acadêmico: vocabulário difícil em inglês, vocabulário de assuntos especializados e linguagem para organizar ensaios e apresentações. Agora, quando você se depara com uma palavra que não conhece em um texto acadêmico ou palestra, você pode tentar adivinhar seu significado sorteando o contexto ou vendo se a palavra se encaixa como uma palavra em seu próprio idioma. Esta é uma estratégia particularmente útil se a sua língua tiver muitas palavras do grego ou do latim, já que muitas das palavras usadas no inglês acadêmico vêm dessas línguas. Por exemplo, palavras como microscópico, que significa minúsculo, ou análise, que significa estudo, ou regeneração, que significa renovar, outra estratégia para trabalhar o encontro é observar como a palavra foi construída. Palavras acadêmicas em inglês têm geralmente prefixos e sufixos.

Lembrar! Um prefixo vem antes da parte principal da palavra e pode alterar o significado da palavra. Por exemplo, o prefixo d significa remover algo ou reverter algo, então d-população significa uma redução no número de pessoas em alguma área, e d-florestamento significa limpar três de uma área.

Os sufixos são anexados ao final das palavras, um sufixo comum em inglês é `ze` soletrar `asi`, exemplos de palavras com `ze` são estabilizar, caracterizar e especializar, essas palavras são soletradas com `AZEDI` no inglês americano, como estão certos, agora outro sufixo comum é `ted` soletrar `ETI`, palavras com este sufixo são diferenciadas e duplicadas, palavras de assuntos especializados também podem causar dificuldade, agora você pode se ajudar de duas maneiras, primeiro prepare-se antes palestras, encontre alguns textos sobre o seu assunto na internet ou em periódicos e revistas e estude as palavras especialistas em recorrência desses textos, sim, e ajude-se com isso, procure no dicionário de inglês, e no dicionário de assuntos de inglês, por exemplo, medicina, direito ou linguística e, em segundo lugar, ouvir rádio em inglês e assistir TV, agora existem muitos recursos especializados que podem ajudá-lo a melhorar seu inglês geral e especializado e, claro, o site da BBC tem seções com histórias sobre tecnologia, e ciência e artes também podem ajudar.

Ao escrever seu artigo acadêmico ou fazer uma apresentação, você precisa estruturar e organizar sua redação ou apresentação usando linguagem de sinalização, você usa sinalização para indicar partes importantes de sua redação, como declarar o propósito, e estruturar seus pontos de vista e pontos principais e a direção do argumento e a conclusão no final também, palavras e frases de ligação mostram conexões entre as frases e parágrafos, sim, Neil vamos pegar alguns exemplos de sinalização, primeiro para iniciar um texto, o objetivo do estudo, este ensaio argumenta que, e como encerrá-lo, finalmente, em conclusão, e alguns exemplos de palavras e frases de ligação são, em primeiro lugar, em segundo lugar, finalmente, e para adicionar algo que você pode escrever, além disso, e se quiser para mostrar contraste, você pode escrever, no entanto, por outro lado.

E agora algumas dicas para tirar o melhor proveito do estudo em inglês. Ok, eu tenho um bom, tenho um colega de estudo, ou seja, alguém com quem vocês podem estudar, testar reciprocamente e apoiar reciprocamente, e outro, reservar um tempo para o estudo regular do idioma além do seu estudo acadêmico.
