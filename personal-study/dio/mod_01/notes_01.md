Atention points - Review

* "**I belive** I will be a good fit **with** your company."
  → Correto: *"I **believe** I will be a good fit **for** your company."*
  **Erros**: Ortografia de "believe" e uso incorreto de preposição ("with" → "for").

* "I **realy** like to stay **a** home after work, to relax and play **gitar**. I'm a very **family oriented** person".
  → Correto: *"I **really** like to stay **at** home after work, to relax and play **guitar**. I'm a very **family-oriented** person."*
  **Erros**: Ortografia ("realy" → "really", "gitar" → "guitar"), preposição ("a home" → "at home") e hífen em "family-oriented".

* "I love to **cook with** my mom, I visit her at least once a week."
  → Correto: *"I love to **cook** with my mom..."*
  **Erro**: A frase está gramaticalmente correta, mas na segunda versão há confusão com "I love to cooking", o que é incorreto (ver nota abaixo). Este item do primeiro bloco, isoladamente, **não possui erro**.

* "At least I **start to learn surf** recently."
  → Correto: *"I **have recently started learning to surf**."*
  **Erros**: Estrutura verbal ("start to learn surf" → incorreta combinação de verbos e ausência de gerúndio), além de "At least" estar fora de contexto.

* "I prefer to start work at eight **PM**, I **fell** the most productive in the morning."
  → Correto: *"I prefer to start work at eight **AM**, I **feel** the most productive in the morning."*
  **Erros**: Horário incorreto (se a pessoa é mais produtiva de manhã, não faz sentido "eight PM"), e erro ortográfico ("fell" → "feel").

* "Then I **lunch** at noon **end** go back to work **one third PM**. I **usualy** finish my work day at five or six PM."
  → Correto: *"Then I **have lunch** at noon **and** go back to work **at one thirty PM**. I **usually** finish my work day at five or six PM."*
  **Erros**: Uso incorreto de "lunch" como verbo, ortografia ("end" → "and", "usualy" → "usually"), e expressão de horário ("one third PM" → provavelmente quis dizer "one thirty PM").
